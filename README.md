# ðŸ§  8-Bit Computer from Scratch (Logisim)

This project is a fully functional **8-bit computer** designed and built from scratch using [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). Inspired by Ben Eaterâ€™s series and classic computer architecture, it aims to demonstrate the fundamentals of digital logic, CPU design, and low-level programming.
